# Sales_Dashboard
1. I have created an Sales Dashboard 🧑‍💼📈.
2. A Sales Dashboard Project is a data visualization tool that presents key metrics and performance indicators related to sales, profits, and 
   employee performance in a single interface.
3. This dashboard focuses on various relations among the different dataset and how they contribute to effective analysis 🔍.
4. I have also used DAX to create explicit measures , calculated columns and summary tables to enhance analytics 📉➕.
5. I utilized the data modelling feature of Power BI to relate these tables by creating a one to many relationship through unique product id, 
   salesperson id etc.
